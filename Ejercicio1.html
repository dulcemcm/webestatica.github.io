    <h1 id="id1">How We Really Use the Web</h1>
    <b>Scanning, satisficing, and muddling through</b> <br>
    <p>
    <b><i>In the past ten years i’ve spent a lot of time watching</i></b>
        people use the Web, and the thing that has struck me most is the difference between how we think people use Web sites and how 
        they actually use them. When we’re creating sites, we act as though people are going to pore over each
        page, reading our finely crafted text, figuring out how we’ve organized things,
        and weighing their options before deciding which link to click.
        What they actually do most of the time (if we’re lucky) is glance at each new page,
        scan some of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or
        vaguely resembles the thing they’re looking for. There are usually large parts of
        the page that they don’t even look at.
        We’re thinking <big>“great literature”</big> (or at least <big>“product brochure”</big>), while the user’s
        reality is much closer to <big>“billboard going by at 60 miles an hour.”</big>
    </p>
    <p>As you might imagine, it’s a little more complicated than this, and it depends on
        the kind of page, what the user is trying to do, how much of a hurry she’s in, and
        so on. But this simplistic view is much closer to reality than most of us imagine.
        It makes sense that we picture a more rational, attentive user when we’re
        designing pages. It’s only natural to assume that everyone uses the Web the same
        way we do, and—like everyone else—we tend to think that our own behavior is
        much more orderly and sensible than it really is.
        If you want to design effective Web pages, though, you have to learn to live with
        three facts about real-world Web use.

    <h3>FACT #1</h3>
    <h2 id="id2">We don't read pages. We scan them</h2>
    <p>
        One of the very few well-documented facts about Web use is that people tend tospend very little time reading most Web pages<sub>1</sub>.
        Instead, we scan (or skim) them, looking for words or phrases that catch our eye.
    </p>
    <p>The exception, of course, is pages that contain documents like news stories,
        reports, or product descriptions. But even then, if the document is longer than a
        few paragraphs, we’re likely to print it out because it’s easier and faster to read on
        paper than on a screen. <br> <em>Why do we scan?</em>
    </p>
    <u>We’re usually in a hurry</u> <br>
    <p>
    <small>Much of our Web use is motivated by the desire to
        save time. As a result, Web users tend to act like sharks: They have to keep
        moving, or they’ll die. We just don’t have the time to read any more than
        necessary</small>
    </p>
    <strong>We know we don’t need to read everything.</strong> <br>
    <p>
        <super>On most pages, we’re really only interested in a fraction of what’s on the page. We’re just looking for the
            bits that match our interests or the task at hand, and the rest of it is irrelevant.
            Scanning is how we find the relevant bits.</super>
    </p>
    <del>We’re good at it.</del> <br>
    <p>
        <i>We’ve been scanning newspapers, magazines, and books all
            our lives to find the parts we’re interested in, and we know that it works.</i>

    <h3>FACT #2</h3>
    <h2 id="id3">We don’t make optimal choices. We satisfice.</h2>
    <p>When we’re designing pages, we tend to assume that users will scan the page,
        consider all of the available options, and choose the best one
    </p>
    <p>In reality, though, most of the time we don’t choose the best option—we choose
        the first reasonable option, a strategy known as satisficing<sub>2</sub>. As soon as we find a
        link that seems like it might lead to what we’re looking for, there’s a very good
        chance that we’ll click it.
